Mandatory assignment for intro to artificial intelligence subject, where we chose task nr 1 Tesla stock price prediction.

We chose the linear regression algorithm because we are dealing with a continously changing value, and in order to predict how the value develops in the future, the process of analyzing the available data in order to further extrapolate the future data. In the case of a stock price prediction this method does have flaws however, because stock price is affected by variables that can not be accounted for when using linear regression. For the purpose of this task though, the linear model works because we are dealing with the relationship between two continously changing variables, price and time. Therfore in this case, the linear model would indicate that price will grow in the future, as it is effective at predicting the continuation of the general trend. The classification algorithm could alternatively be used to predict if the price would go up or down.
